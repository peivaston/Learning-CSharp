# Learning-CSharp
In this repository, you can follow my path to learning C#. My goal is to learn and get a better developer. To do so, I need practice. Practice makes perfect.


I aspire to be a great developer, who will in the future have lots of knowledge about the different technologies and be beneficial for my co-workers, company and myself.
